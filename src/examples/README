This directory contains simple examples intended to unit test individual
features of the CHIMES compiler and runtime. These tests are split into C/C++
only tests, tests with OpenMP pragmas, and tests with CUDA kernels.

A prototype of CUDA support was implemented at one point, but it is not
currently supported.
