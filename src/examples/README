Plugin passes put underneath ${HOME}/dev/llvm/llvm/lib/Transforms are compiled into
libraries under ${HOME}/dev/llvm/build/Debug+Asserts/lib/.

To load one of those libraries with LLVM, use opt -load ${path-to-dylib}.

You can verify that the library is loaded by running
    opt -load ${path-to-dylib} -help
and checking that it shows up in the usage.

LLVM bitcode files (.bc) can be generated from .c files using:
    clang -S -emit-llvm foo.c -o foo.bc

You can then run the custom pass on the bitcode file using:
    opt -load ${path-to-dylib} -pass < foo.bc

You can visuzlize alias sets using:
    opt -basicaa -disable-output -print-alias-sets test.bc
